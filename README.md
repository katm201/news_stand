## News Stand

> The goal of News Stand is to provide users a clean, all-in-one place to find, consume, and comment on the news. News sites are fragmented and RSS feeds donâ€™t allow users to comment, so we want to combine the two.

> Our project is built using the MERN stack.

## Usage

From the command line, run the following commands:

Clone:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/news-stand/news_stand
```

Navigate Into Repo:
```sh
cd news_stand
```

Install Dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```


Start:
```sh
npm run start:dev
```
Note: This starts the Webpack bundler and Babel transpiler, which run in parallel with nodemon to run your server. You only need one open "running" terminal, rather than three. All three will watch for changes, so you don't need to re-run or re-start any of the processes.

## Transpiling / Scripts
Our two main `package.json` scripts for transpiling our es6 syntax into es5 produciton code are:

```node
"build:server": "babel ./app/server -d build/server",
```

```node
"build:client": "webpack --config ./webpack.config.js/"
```

`build:client` triggers webpack to transpile and bundle all of our client side code into a `bundle.js` file found inside the `build` folder.

`build:server` uses babel to transpile our server side code into the `build` folder. This is how we are able to use es6 syntax in our server side code. It is important to note that any relative paths used in server-side code are in realtion to the code found in the `build` folder.

## Development

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

### Setting Environment Variables

This project uses the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) module to read and configure environment variables from a .env file. The .env is included in .gitignore and is where you should store your API keys.

```sh
# in your root directory, to create the file:
touch .env
```

The .env reads bash commands, so set environment variables like you would in the terminal.

```sh
# for example:
NEWS_KEY=yourKeyHere
```

At the top of the file where you're using the environment
variables (or at the root of your project), import or require
the dotenv module and use it to make your variables set in the
.env file available to your code.

```node
// in ES5:
var dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();

// in ES6:
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
```

You then can access the environment variables in your JavaScript files.

```node
// for example:
search = `https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=art&sources=bbc-news&sortBy=popularity&apiKey=${process.env.NEWS_KEY}`
```

### News API

This project uses information from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). For development, you'll need an API key that you set in your environment variables. 

Endpoints:
  - [/v2/everything](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything): For articles searches
  - [/v2/sources](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/sources): For an up-to-date list of possible sources to query
